# Speech Recognition and Text Transcription

This Python program uses the SpeechRecognition library to capture audio from the microphone and convert it into text using the Google Speech Recognition service.

## Dependencies

The program requires the `speech_recognition` Python library for speech recognition.

## Key Features

- `speech_to_text()`: Captures audio from the microphone, processes it, and returns the transcription of the recognized text using the Google Speech Recognition service.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the `speech_recognition` library is installed.
2. Run the `main.py` Python file.
3. The program will initiate speech recognition and start transcribing what is spoken into the microphone.

The program will continue to capture and transcribe audio until manually interrupted.

Make sure you have a functional microphone and an active Internet connection to use speech recognition via Google.
